# ✨ Predictive Text Generator

This project is a simple **Predictive Text Generator** built in Python.  
It uses a **bigram model** (word pairs) to predict the next possible word and also generates short sentences.

## 📂 Project Files
- `predictive.py` → Main Python script (run this file).
- `data.txt` → Training text file that provides the words for prediction.
- `history.txt` → Stores your interaction history.
- `README.md` → Project description file.

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Keep all files (`predictive.py`, `data.txt`, `history.txt`) in the same folder.
3. Open a terminal in that folder and run:

```bash
python predictive.py

## Example Usage

Type 'exit' to quit.

You: python  
🔮 Predictions: is, widely  
📝 Generated sentence: python is widely used


📌 Future Improvements

Use Trigram/Neural Networks for better predictions

Add GUI interface

Allow user to upload their own dataset
